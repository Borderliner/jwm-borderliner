#What is this?<br>
This is my own configuration file for <a href="http://joewing.net/projects/jwm/" target="_blank">JWM</a> (Joe's Window Manager)<br>
It consists of a config file (.jwmrc), and a wallpaper (.wallpaper.png).<br>
I've included a script file (install.sh) to install this config, plus it's necessary components.<br><br>

#How do I install this?<br>
Clone this repo, cd into it, execute `./install.sh` to run the script (DO NOT RUN IT AS ADMIN, IF YOU DO, IT WILL INSTALL TO /root/.jwmrc)<br>
It is <b>STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to install Xfce components</b>, which is prompt during the installation process.<br><br>
